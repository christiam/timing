This is a generic runtime timing framework.
By providing commands in the etc/cmds.tab file and setting the number of
repetitions on the Makefile (default value provided), one can record the
runtime (wall clock, system and user time as well as timestamp) of test cases.

Instructions
------------
1. Edit the bin/setup-tests.sh script to easily overwrite the file containing
the commands to run (etc/cmds.tab). This file should contain lines with the
format "label\tcmd" format.

Manifest
bin/driver.pl: Main driver script
bin/reports.pl: Extracts data from database and prints various statistical
measures
bin/setup-tests.sh: facilitates setting up the system to run tests
bin/multi-series-extractor.pl: intended for identical test cases run in series
(e.g.: with N-M threads) that should be compared across the board.
bin/data2gnuplot.pl: Plots multiple data sets into a single data file, intended
to produce histograms
